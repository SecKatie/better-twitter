# Better Twitter

This is a simple userscript that I am developing to make Twitter just a little bit better.

## Features

- Adds a block button to each tweet (quickly block annoying people)
- Automatically hides all replies from "verified" accounts (removes 90% of transphobia & other garbage)

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (or another userscript manager)
2. Open the "Utilities" tab in Tampermonkey
3. Copy the URL to the file `better-twitter.VERSION.user.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/SecKatie/better-twitter/releases) and paste it next to the "Import from URL" field
4. Click install
5. Enjoy!
